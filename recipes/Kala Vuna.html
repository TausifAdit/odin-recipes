    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kala Bhuna (Bengali: কালা ভুনা, Chittagonian: হালা ভুনো, romanized: Hala Bhuno) is a famous dark and tender dish native to Chittagong prepared with shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices; usually served during Mezban.
        It was originally served during the early 17th century.
        However, the origin of the dish is unknown.</p>
    <p>Bhuna (Chittagonian) means deep-frying; derived from Bhunna (Urdu) meaning to be fried and the word Kala means dark or black in Chittagonian.
        Natives of Chittagong used to cover their fried dark and tendered beef dish using banana leaves and packed it for long tours on foot, nowadays aluminium foil is used instead of the traditional banana leaf.</p>
