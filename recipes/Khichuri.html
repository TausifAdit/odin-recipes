    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Be it rain or winter morning, there is no end to the Bengalis' obsession with khichuri (a local dish).
    Apart from being delicious, the appeal of khichuri is incomparable to everyone from students to unmarried people for its relatively time-saving and simple cooking process.</p>
    <p>Just like this two days ago, a bachelor colleague of mine posted a picture of his cooked khichuri on Facebook.
    Despite his reluctance, as he said in the post, he set out to cook khichuri even in the scorching heat to prepare his lunch briefly.
    But before the end of cooking, it suddenly rained, ending him up with the childish Facebook post.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Mung bean</li>
        <li>2 cups Basmati rice</li>
        <li>½ cup ghee or butter</li>
        <li>½ cup onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 green chilies</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 cinnamon, about 1" each</li>
        <li>5 cups boiled water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice and mung bean. Strain all the water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add ghee/butter to a pan on medium heat. Add onion and saute until it gets slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Add everything from chilies to cinnamon. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add salt and boiled water. At the sight of bubbles, put a lid on the pan and cook for 20-22 minutes or until rice and bean are done.</li>
        <li>Your bhuna khichuri is ready. Serve it with pickled onion.</li>
        <li>Wasn't it so easy to cook the popular Bengali dish? I wonder why the government officials are going that far spending public money to learn it!</li>
    </ol>
